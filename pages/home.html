    <h4>Description of the Panda Bear</h4>
    <P>Pandas are probably the most easily recognized bear in the world. Their fur is starkly contrasting patches of black and white, with black ears and black eye patches. Their legs, shoulders, and tail are also black, and the rest of their body is white.
    Pandas, like most bears, have short tails, measuring between 4 and 6 inches long. They are moderately large bears, and males can weigh up to 350 lbs. or more. However, most pandas average between 220 and 254 pounds or so.</P>
    <h4>Habitat of the Panda Bear</h4>
    <P>Pandas must live in habitats with plenty of bamboo forest to feed from. In addition to high volumes of bamboo, they must also have more than one species of bamboo to survive.

        In their natural range, most bears live in mountainous regions or valleys. They will also move to various habitats to follow the growth of bamboo shoots, because leaves are much more nutritious, and grow at different altitudes in different seasons.</P>

    <h4>Distribution of the Panda Bear</h4>
    <P>In the wild, humans have restricted pandas to a few tiny ranges of habitat. There are populations across a few mountain ranges in central China, but these populations are fragmented. This means that they are far enough apart to prevent breeding between two populations, resulting in lower genetic diversity and increased inbreeding.

        Most pandas reside in the Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu Mountains. Historically, they also inhabited the surrounding lowland areas, but habitat loss has driven them out of these areas.</P>
    <h4>Panda Bear and Human Interaction</h4>
    <P>The primary dangers to panda survival are habitat loss, poaching, and fragmented populations. Hunting of these bears has occurred for hundreds of years, primarily because their fur is so soft and strikingly colored.

        As human populations increased, people began to develop more and more land. This reduced the usable habitat for pandas, causing additional decline. Conservation efforts were poorly conducted until the 1990s, and to this day pandas are still threatened with extinction. The IUCN Red List classifies pandas as Vulnerable.</P>
